Packages and libraries in Python

A package in Python is a way to organize modules, which are Python files with definitions and statements, into a directory hierarchy. Packages allow for a namespace and can be organized to help prevent naming collisions between modules. Packages can contain sub-packages, which themselves can contain modules, and so on. To use a module in a package, one imports the module using the dot (.) syntax. For example, if a package "mypackage" contains a module "mymodule", one can import it with "import mypackage.mymodule".

You can import packages using the following:
`import math`

There are many packages one can import

### Libraries in Python

- A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we donâ€™t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.

These are some standar libraries below.

### What is Python Module 
- A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. It also makes the code logically organized.


- A simple module, calc.py, whuch has 2 functions one add and another subtract.

`def add(x, y):
    return (x+y)`

`def subtract(x, y):
	return (x-y)`

This image below also shows some of the differences between Modules and Packages.

- The main difference between a module and a package in Python is that a module is a simple Python script with a .py extension file that contains collections of functions and global variables. In contrast, a package is a directory that contains a collection of modules, and this directory also contains an __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a package.
